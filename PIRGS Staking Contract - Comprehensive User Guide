# PIRGS Staking Guide: Maximizing Your Token Rewards

## Introduction to PIRGS Staking

Welcome to the PIRGS staking platform! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about staking your PIRGS tokens and earning rewards.

### What is Staking?

Staking allows you to lock your PIRGS tokens for a predetermined period and earn additional tokens as rewards. By participating in staking, you're supporting the PIRGS ecosystem while potentially increasing your token holdings.

## Staking Options

   - Ideal for: Conservative investors, short-term participants

2. **Medium-Term Stake (180 Days)**
   - Lock Period: 6 months
   - Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 20%
   - Ideal for: Balanced investors seeking moderate returns

3. **Long-Term Stake (365 Days)**

## Step-by-Step Staking Process

### 1. Prepare Your Tokens
- Ensure you have PIRGS tokens in your wallet
- Verify your token balance
- Decide which staking option suits your investment strategy

### 2. Approve Token Spending
Before staking, you must approve the staking contract to spend your tokens:
1. Open your wallet/interface
2. Navigate to the PIRGS token
3. Find the "Approve" function
4. Set the amount you wish to stake
5. Approve the staking contract address

### 3. Stake Your Tokens
- Select your preferred staking option
- Enter the amount of tokens to stake
- Confirm the transaction
- Pay attention to gas fees

## Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated based on:
- Amount of tokens staked
- Chosen staking duration
- Current reward rate for that staking option

### Example Calculation
- Stake 1000 PIRGS in 12-month option (30% APY)
- Potential annual reward: 300 PIRGS
- Pro-rated based on actual staking duration

## Unstaking and Withdrawing

### Conditions for Withdrawal
- You can only withdraw after the lock period ends
- Rewards are calculated up to the lock period expiration

### Unstaking Process
1. Navigate to your active stakes
2. Select the stake you want to withdraw
3. Confirm unstaking
4. Receive both your original stake and accumulated rewards

## Emergency Unstaking

If you need to withdraw before the lock period:
- You can use emergency unstake
- WARNING: Emergency unstake will:
  * Forfeit all accumulated rewards
  * Only return your original staked amount
  * Incur no additional penalties

## Important Considerations
